# Built-in car hotspot setup

DiAuto & DiPlay — Built-in car hotspot test builds
28 September 2026

DiAuto-connection-setup-test.apk: Android phone / Android Auto
DiPlay-connection-setup-test.apk: iPhone / Apple CarPlay
Install the APK on the car, not on your phone. Update the matching existing
test app without uninstalling to preserve settings.

These builds remove the Local hotspot option. Built-in car hotspot is the
default; Wi-Fi Direct and USB remain available. Previous Local hotspot
selections switch to built-in hotspot. Check and save the car's real hotspot
details before connecting.

IN-SESSION SETTINGS AND AUTHENTICATION — DIPLAY
In CarPlay, swipe down with the configured number of fingers (2, 3 or 4;
default 3) to open the hidden settings menu. Opening or cancelling the menu
keeps a healthy session connected. Save and reconnect applies the edits;
Back or X discards them. A connection lost while the menu is open recovers
on closing, unless Wi-Fi requires the existing manual reset action.

The hidden menu offers Local offline and USB/CH341 authentication. Local is
the default and requires a provisioned identity for the first connection.
Selecting USB/CH341 and saving uses the configured CH341 bridge for this and
subsequent connections, without installing or loading local identity files,
even if they already exist. Allow Android's USB permission prompt. A missing
bridge waits for hardware; it does not fall back to local authentication.
Connecting the CH341 bridge does not change wireless CarPlay to wired mode.
Switching back to Local validates the identity before saving; failure keeps
the menu open and preserves the previously saved authentication choice.

BUILT-IN HOTSPOT SETUP — BOTH APPS
1. In the car's settings, turn on its built-in Wi-Fi hotspot. Select 5 GHz
   if available. Note the hotspot name and password exactly.
2. Open DiAuto or DiPlay on the car. Go to Settings → Connection setup
   (tap Open connection setup if shown).
3. Select Built-in car hotspot. Tap Save hotspot details and use this mode
   (or Edit saved hotspot), enter the car's hotspot name and password, and
   save. Use Hide keyboard if needed. Leave the car hotspot on.
4. Turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on your phone. Pair it with the car's
   Bluetooth. Allow the app permissions requested on the car.
5. Return to the app and tap Connect phone. Select your phone when asked.
   In DiPlay, use Choose iPhone if you need to select a different phone.
6. Accept the Android Auto or CarPlay prompts on your phone.

You do not need to join the hotspot manually on your phone before tapping
Connect phone. The app sends its details over Bluetooth so the phone can
join automatically. Use the car's hotspot, not your phone's Personal Hotspot.
ADB is not required for this connection setup. A car internet plan is not
required; phone internet availability depends on its network settings.
If you change the car hotspot name or password, update it in the app too.
Test one projection app at a time.

EXISTING WI-FI / SAME LAN — DIPLAY
Connect the car and iPhone to the same external router or portable Wi-Fi in
system settings. In DiPlay Connection setup, select Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN
and save that network's exact name and WPA2 password. Keep Bluetooth enabled,
then connect as usual. No car hotspot or Wi-Fi Direct group is created. Disable
router client isolation. See [Existing Wi-Fi](EXISTING_WIFI.md) for build
requirements, network limitations and device validation.

WI-FI DIRECT CHANNEL — DIPLAY
In Settings → Connection setup, choose Wi-Fi Direct, then Preferred channel.
Auto is the default and keeps DiPlay's automatic channel selection. You can
choose a 5 GHz channel (36, 40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157, 161 or 165), or a
2.4 GHz channel (1–11). The car and its regional Wi-Fi settings must support
the selected channel. Save applies the choice to the next Wi-Fi Direct
connection; an existing connection continues until you disconnect/reconnect.
If the car rejects the channel or creates a different one, DiPlay reports an
error. Choose Auto or another channel and reconnect. Switching to the built-in
hotspot preserves this choice without applying it to the car hotspot.
